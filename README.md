# Image-Classification

### Goal
- Using pretrained image classification models, I will try and classify a set of images and add a description of the object identified (a #hashtag generator essentially). 

### How has this been solved?
- Image classification if a hugely popular ML application with many sucessful models created in the field - thus my intention to use open source pre-trained models. 

### What is new about my approach
- While I need to work out some details on exactly what classification I would like to do, my approach will serve to showcase my ability to use the power pretrained models as a tool successfully,

### Who Cares?
- Image classification is widely applicable to different businesses existing today. A specific use-case would be a service based company that relies upon customer loaded images to build client profiles (like Yelp). Successful image classification would go a long way in allowing the images to be utilized more successfully. 

### How will I present?
- I will present my project through github, and will make a video presenting my work.

### Data source
- I would like to scrub the data online, but as a backup I could use the Google Open Images Dataset V6, which includes 1,743,042 images in the training set. 

### Potential Problems
- Making my project stand-out is still something I feel less sure about, but I think showcasing this skill would be very useful in presenting myself as a capable data scientist.

### Next thing?
- Selecting what identification I would be interested in.
